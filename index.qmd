## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 60 points
Prediction of Median House prices
:::

###### 1.1 (2.5 points)


The `data` folder contains the `housing.csv` dataset which contains housing prices in California from the 1990 California census. The objective is to predict the median house price for California districts based on various features.


Read the data file as a tibble in R. Preprocess the data such that:

1. the variables are of the right data type, e.g., categorical variables are encoded as factors
2. all column names to lower case for consistency
3. Any observations with missing values are dropped

```R
path <- "data/housing.csv"

df <- 
  read_csv(path) %>% 
  mutate(
    ocean_proximity = factor(ocean_proximity)
  ) %>% 
  rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

---

###### 1.2 (2.5 points)

Visualize the correlation matrix of all numeric columns in `df` using `corrplot()`

```R
df %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(type = "upper", method = "color", order = "hclust")
```

---

###### 1.3 (5 points)

Split the data `df` into `df_train` and `df_split` using `test_ind` in the code below:

```R
set.seed(42)
test_ind <- sample(
  1:nrow(df), 
  floor( nrow(df)/10 ),
  replace=FALSE
)

df_train <- df[-test_ind, ]
df_test  <- df[test_ind, ]
```

---

###### 1.4 (5 points)

Fit a linear regression model to predict the `median_house_value` :

* `latitude`
* `longitude`
* `housing_median_age`
* `total_rooms`
* `total_bedrooms`
* `population`
* `median_income`
* `ocean_proximity`

Interpret the coefficients and summarize your results. 

```R
lm_fit <- lm(median_house_value ~ latitude + longitude + housing_median_age + total_rooms + 
                total_bedrooms + population + median_income + 
                ocean_proximity, data = df_train)
summary(lm_fit)
```

For every latitude change of 1, the median house value changes by -2.273e+06. And when ocean_proximity changes from <1H OCEAN to ocean_proximityINLAND, the median house value changes by -4.018e+04.

---

###### 1.5 (5 points)

Complete the `rmse` function for computing the Root Mean-Squared Error between the true `y` and the predicted `yhat`, and use it to compute the RMSE for the regression model on `df_test`

```R
rmse <- function(y, yhat) {
  sqrt(mean((y - yhat)^2))
}

lm_predictions <- predict(lm_fit, newdata = df_test)
rmse(df_test$median_house_value, lm_predictions)
```


###### 1.6 (5 points)

Fit a decision tree model to predict the `median_house_value` using the same predictors as in 1.4. Use the `rpart()` function.

```R
rpart_fit <- rpart(
  formula = median_house_value ~ .,
  data = df_train,
  method = "anova"
)

```


Visualize the decision tree using the `rpart.plot()` function. 

```R
rpart.plot(rpart_fit)
```


Report the root mean squared error on the test set.
75876.87

```R
rpart_predictions <- predict(
  object = rpart_fit,
  newdata = df_test
)

rmse(rpart_predictions, df_test$median_house_value)
```

---

###### 1.7 (5 points)

Fit a support vector machine model to predict the `median_house_value` using the same predictors as in 1.4. Use the `svm()` function and use any kernel of your choice. Report the root mean squared error on the test set.
56663.75

```R
svm_fit <- svm(
  formula = median_house_value ~ .,
  data = df_train,
  kernel = "radial"
)
svm_predictions <- predict(
  object = svm_fit,
  newdata = df_test
)
rmse(df_test$median_house_value, svm_predictions)
```

---

###### 1.8 (25 points)

Initialize a neural network model architecture:

```R
NNet <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(p, q1, q2, q3) {  
    self$hidden1 <- nn_linear(p, q1)
    self$hidden2 <- nn_linear(q1, q2)
    self$hidden3 <- nn_linear(q2, q3)
    self$output <- nn_linear(q3, 1)
    self$activation <- nn_relu()
    self$sigmoid <- nn_sigmoid()
  },
    
  forward = function(x) {
    x %>% 
      self$hidden1() %>% self$activation() %>% 
      self$hidden2() %>% self$activation() %>% 
      self$hidden3() %>% self$activation() %>% 
      self$output() %>% self$sigmoid()
  }
)
```


Fit a neural network model to predict the `median_house_value` using the same predictors as in 1.4. Use the `model.matrix` function to create the covariate matrix and `luz` package for fitting the network with $32, 16, 8$ nodes in each of the three hidden layers. 

```R
M <- model.matrix(median_house_value ~ 0 + ., data = df_train)

fit_nn <- NNet %>%
  #
  # Setup the model
  #
  setup(
    loss = nn_bce_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam, 
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy()
    )
  ) %>% 
  #
  # Set the hyperparameters
  #
  set_hparams(p=ncol(M), q1=32, q2=16, q3=8) %>% 
  set_opt_hparams(lr=0.001) %>% 
  #
  # Fit the model
  #
  fit(
    data = list(
      model.matrix(median_house_value ~ 0 + ., data = df_train),
      df_train %>% select(median_house_value) %>% as.matrix
    ),
    valid_data = list(
      model.matrix(median_house_value ~ 0 + ., data = df_test),
      df_test %>% select(median_house_value) %>% as.matrix
    ),
    epochs = 50, 
    verbose = FALSE
  )

```

Plot the results of the training and validation loss and accuracy.

```R
plot(fit_nn)
```


Report the root mean squared error on the test set.
-2.11096e+07

```R
nnet_predictions <- fit_nn %>% predict(
  model.matrix(median_house_value ~ 0 + ., data = df_test)
)
nnet_loss <- nn_bce_loss()(nnet_predictions, df_test$median_house_value)
nnet_loss
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Remember to use the `as_array()` function to convert the predictions to a vector of numbers before computing the RMSE with `rmse()`
:::

---

###### 1.9 (5 points)

Summarize your results in a table comparing the RMSE for the different models. Which model performed best? Why do you think that is?
The smallest RMSE is from the radial dataset from svm. Svm is a more flexible model, which can account for more variability.

```R
results_table <- data.frame(c(
rmse(df_test$median_house_value, lm_predictions), rmse(rpart_predictions, df_test$median_house_value), rmse(df_test$median_house_value, svm_predictions)))

results_table
```

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 50 points
Spam email classification
:::

The `data` folder contains the `spam.csv` dataset. This dataset contains features extracted from a collection of spam and non-spam emails. The objective is to classify the emails as spam or non-spam.

---

###### 2.1 (2.5 points)

Read the data file as a tibble in R. Preprocess the data such that:

1. the variables are of the right data type, e.g., categorical variables are encoded as factors
2. all column names to lower case for consistency
3. Any observations with missing values are dropped

```R
df <- read.csv("data/spambase.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>% 
  rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

---

###### 2.2 (2.5 points)

Split the data `df` into `df_train` and `df_split` using `test_ind` in the code below:

```R
set.seed(42)
test_ind <- sample(
  1:nrow(df), 
  floor( nrow(df)/10 ),
  replace=FALSE
)

df_train <- df[-test_ind,]
df_test  <- df[test_ind,]
```

Complete the `overview` function which returns a data frame with the following columns: `accuracy`, `error`, `false positive rate`, `true positive rate`, between the true `true_class` and the predicted `pred_class` for any classification model.

```R
overview <- function(pred_class, true_class) {
  accuracy <- sum(pred_class == true_class) / length(true_class)
  error <- 1 - accuracy
  true_positives <- sum(pred_class == "spam" & true_class == "spam")
  true_negatives <- sum(pred_class == "nonspam" & true_class == "nonspam")
  false_positives <- sum(pred_class == "spam" & true_class == "nonspam")
  false_negatives <- sum(pred_class == "nonspam" & true_class == "spam")
  true_positive_rate <- true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
  false_positive_rate <- false_positives / (false_positives + true_negatives)
  return(
    data.frame(
      accuracy = accuracy,
      error = error,
      true_positive_rate = true_positive_rate,
      false_positive_rate = false_positive_rate
    )
  )
}
```


---

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Fit a logistic regression model to predict the `spam` variable using the remaining predictors. Report the prediction accuracy on the test set.

```R
glm_fit <- glm(spam ~ ., data = df_train, family = "binomial")
glm_classes <- predict(glm_fit, newdata = df_test, type = "response")
glm_acc <- mean((glm_classes > 0.5) == df_test$spam)
glm_acc

```

---

###### 2.4 (5 points)

Fit a decision tree model to predict the `spam` variable using the remaining predictors. Use the `rpart()` function and set the `method` argument to `"class"`. 

```R
rpart_fit <- rpart(spam ~ ., data = df_train, method = "class")
rpart_classes <- predict(rpart_fit, newdata = df_test, type = "class")
```

Visualize the decision tree using the `rpart.plot()` function. 

```R
rpart.plot(rpart_fit)
```

Report the prediction accuracy on the test set.
0.8782609

```R
rpart_classes <- predict(rpart_fit, newdata = df_test, type = "class")
rpart_accuracy <- sum(rpart_classes == df_test$spam) / nrow(df_test)
rpart_accuracy
```

---

###### 2.5 (5 points)

Fit a support vector machine model to predict the `spam` variable using the remaining predictors. Use the `svm()` function and use any kernel of your choice. Remember to set the `type` argument to `"C-classification"` **if you haven't** already converted `spam` to be of type `factor`.


```R
svm_fit <- svm(spam ~ ., data = df_train, kernel = "radial", type = "C-classification")
```
Report the prediction accuracy on the test set.

```R
svm_classes <- predict(svm_fit, newdata = df_test)
svm_accuracy <- sum(svm_classes == df_test$spam) / nrow(df_test)
svm_accuracy
```

---

###### 2.6 (25 points)

Using the same neural network architecture as in 1.9, fit a neural network model to predict the `spam` variable using the remaining predictors. 

::: {.callout-warning}
## Classification vs. Regression

Note that the neural network in **Q 1.9** was a regression model. You will need to modify the neural network architecture to be a classification model by changing the output layer to have a single node with a sigmoid activation function.
:::

Use the `model.matrix` function to create the covariate matrix and `luz` package for fitting the network with $32, 16, 8$ nodes in each of the three hidden layers. 

```R
M <- model.matrix(spam ~ 0 + ., data = df_train)

fit_nn <- NNet %>%
  #
  # Setup the model
  #
  setup(
    loss = nn_bce_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam, 
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy()
    )
  ) %>% 
  #
  # Set the hyperparameters
  #
  set_hparams(p=ncol(M), q1=32, q2=16, q3=8) %>% 
  set_opt_hparams(lr=0.001) %>% 
  #
  # Fit the model
  #
  fit(
    data = list(
      model.matrix(spam ~ 0 + ., data = df_train),
      df_train %>% select(spam) %>% as.matrix %>% torch_tensor(dtype = torch_float())
    ),
    valid_data = list(
      model.matrix(spam ~ 0 + ., data = df_test),
      df_test %>% select(spam) %>% as.matrix %>% torch_tensor(dtype = torch_float())
    ),
    epochs = 50, 
    verbose = FALSE
  )


```

---

###### 2.7 (5 points)

Summarize your results in a table comparing the accuracy metrics for the different models. 

```R
tibble(
  model = c("Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree", "Support Vector Machine"),
  accuracy = c(glm_acc, rpart_accuracy, svm_accuracy)
)
```

If you were to choose a model to classify spam emails, which model would you choose? Think about the context of the problem and the cost of false positives and false negatives.

Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine have the highest accuracies. We don't want false positives, as they're when we don't get emails that are important. Logistic Regression will likely run faster.

## Question 3

## 60 points

Three spirals classification

:::

To better illustrate the power of depth in neural networks, we will use a toy dataset called the "Three Spirals" data. This dataset consists of two intertwined spirals, making it challenging for shallow models to classify the data accurately. 

::: {.callout-warning}
## This is a multi-class classification problem
:::

The dataset can be generated using the provided R code below:

```{R}
generate_three_spirals <- function(){
  set.seed(42)
  n <- 500
  noise <- 0.2
  t <- (1:n) / n * 2 * pi
  x1 <- c(
      t * (sin(t) + rnorm(n, 0, noise)),
      t * (sin(t + 2 * pi/3) + rnorm(n, 0, noise)),
      t * (sin(t + 4 * pi/3) + rnorm(n, 0, noise))
    )
  x2 <- c(
      t * (cos(t) + rnorm(n, 0, noise)),
      t * (cos(t + 2 * pi/3) + rnorm(n, 0, noise)),
      t * (cos(t + 4 * pi/3) + rnorm(n, 0, noise))
    )
  y <- as.factor(
    c(
      rep(0, n), 
      rep(1, n), 
      rep(2, n)
    )
  )
  return(tibble(x1=x1, x2=x2, y=y))
}
```

---

###### 3.1 (5 points)

Generate the three spirals dataset using the code above. Plot $x_1$ vs $x_2$ and use the `y` variable to color the points. 


```{R}
df <- generate_three_spirals()

plot(
  df$x1, df$x2,
  col = df$y,
  pch = 20
)
```

Define a grid of $100$ points from $-10$ to $10$ in both $x_1$ and $x_2$ using the `expand.grid()`. Save it as a tibble called `df_test`. 

```R
grid <- seq(-10, 10, length = 100)
df_test <- expand.grid(x1 = grid, x2 = grid) %>% as_tibble()

```

---

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Fit a classification tree model to predict the `y` variable using the `x1` and `x2` predictors, and plot the decision boundary. 

```R
rpart_fit <- rpart(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df, method = "class")
rpart_classes <- predict(rpart_fit, newdata = df_test, type = "class")
```

Plot the decision boundary using the following function:

```R
plot_decision_boundary <- function(predictions){
  plot(
    df_test$x1, df_test$x2, 
    col = predictions,
    pch = 0
  )
  points(
    df$x1, df$x2,
    col = df$y,
    pch = 20
  )
}
```

```R
plot_decision_boundary(rpart_classes)
```

---

###### 3.3 (10 points)

Fit a support vector machine model to predict the `y` variable using the `x1` and `x2` predictors. Use the `svm()` function and use any kernel of your choice. Remember to set the `type` argument to `"C-classification"` **if you haven't** converted `y` to be of type `factor`.

```R
svm_fit <- svm(y ~ ., data = df, kernel = "radial", cost = 10)
svm_classes <- predict(svm_fit, newdata = df_test)
plot_decision_boundary(svm_classes)
```

---

::: {.callout-warning}
## Instructions

For the next questions, you will need to fit a series of neural networks. In all cases, you can:

* set the number of units in each hidden layer to 10 
* set the output dimension `o` to 3 (remember this is multinomial classification)
* use the appropriate loss function for the problem (**not `nn_bce_loss`**)
* set the number of epochs to $50$
* fit the model using the `luz` package

You can use any optimizer of your choice, but you **will need to tune the learning rate for each problem**.
:::


###### 3.4 (10 points)

Fit a neural network with **1 hidden layer** to predict the `y` variable using the `x1` and `x2` predictors.

```R
NN1 <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(p, q1){
    self$hidden1 <- nn_linear(p, q1)
    self$output <- nn_linear(q1, 3)
    self$activation <- nn_relu()
    self$sigmoid <- nn_sigmoid()
  },
  forward = function(x){
    x %>% 
      self$hidden1() %>% 
      self$activation() %>% 
      self$output() %>%
      self$sigmoid()
  }
)

fit_1 <- NN1 %>%
  setup(
    loss = nn_cross_entropy_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam, 
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy()
    )
  ) %>% 
  set_hparams(p=2, q1=10) %>% 
  set_opt_hparams(lr=0.01) %>%
  fit(
    data = list(
      x = df %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix(),
      y = df %>% pull(y) %>% as.numeric() %>% as.factor()
    ),
    dataloader_options = list(num_workers = 0, drop_last = TRUE),
    epochs = 50,
    verbose = FALSE
  )


```

In order to generate the class predictions, you will need to use the `predict()` function as follows

```R
test_matrix <- df_test %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix

fit_1_predictions <- predict(fit_1, test_matrix) %>% 
  argmax(2) %>% 
  as.integer()

plot_decision_boundary(fit_1_predictions)
```

Plot the results using the `plot_decision_boundary()` function.

```R
NN0 <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(p){
    self$output <- nn_linear(p, 3)
    self$sigmoid <- nn_sigmoid()
  },
  forward = function(x){
    x %>% 
      self$output() %>%
      self$sigmoid()
  }
)

fit_0 <- NN0 %>%
  setup(
    loss = nn_cross_entropy_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam, 
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy()
    )
  ) %>%

  fit(
    data = list(
      x = df %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix(),
      y = df %>% pull(y) %>% as.numeric() %>% as.factor()
    ),
    dataloader_options = list(num_workers = 0, drop_last = TRUE),
    epochs = 50,
    verbose = FALSE
  )


```

Plot the results using the `plot_decision_boundary()` function.

```{R}
test_matrix <- df_test %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix

fit_0_predictions <- predict(fit_0, test_matrix) %>%
  argmax(2) %>%
  as.integer()

plot_decision_boundary(fit_0_predictions)
```


---


###### 3.6 (10 points)

Fit a neural network with **3 hidden layers** to predict the `y` variable using the `x1` and `x2` predictors.

```R
NN3 <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(p, q1, q2, q3){
    self$hidden1 <- nn_linear(p, q1)
    self$hidden2 <- nn_linear(q1, q2)

    x %>% 
      self$hidden1() %>% 
      self$activation() %>% 
      self$hidden2() %>% 
      self$activation() %>% 
      self$hidden3() %>% 
      self$activation() %>% 
      self$output() %>%
      self$sigmoid()
  }
)

fit_3 <- NN3 %>%
  setup(
    loss = nn_cross_entropy_loss(),
    optimizer = optim_adam, 
    metrics = list(
      luz_metric_accuracy()
    )
  ) %>% 
  set_hparams(p=2, q1=10, q2=10, q3=10) %>% 
  set_opt_hparams(lr=0.01) %>%
  fit(
    data = list(
      x = df %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix(),
      y = df %>% pull(y) %>% as.numeric() %>% as.factor()
    ),
    dataloader_options = list(num_workers = 0, drop_last = TRUE),

  )

```

Plot the results using the `plot_decision_boundary()` function.

```{R}
 test_matrix <- df_test %>% select(x1, x2) %>% as.matrix()

 fit_3_predictions <- predict(fit_3, test_matrix) %>%
   argmax(2) %>%
   as.integer()

 plot_decision_boundary(fit_3_predictions)
```

###### 3.7 (5 points)

What are the differences between the models? How do the decision boundaries change as the number of hidden layers increases?
The more hidden layers there are, the more complicated and accurate the model becomes. The more hidden layers we have, the more accurate the decision boundary will be.
